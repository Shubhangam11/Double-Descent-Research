# Double-Descent-Research
To setup up the experiment, download the zip file from https://github.com/chenpf1025/noisy_label_understanding_utilizing.

Extract https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz to data/cifar-10-batches-py

The code will automatically add noise to CIFAR-10 by randomly flipping original labels..

Load this repository on your notebook, if you are using Google Colab, load it to your drive.
